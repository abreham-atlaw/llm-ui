# Model Section

The model section of this documentation outlines the structure and customization of the user model used for authentication within the Django project. The authentication process involves extending the `AbstractBaseUser`, creating a custom user manager, and configuring the authentication system to use simple tokens.

## User Model Configuration

### Extending AbstractBaseUser

To customize the user model, we extend the `AbstractBaseUser`. This allows the definition of additional fields and methods specific to our application's needs.

#### File: `apps/authentication/models/user.py`

```python
# apps/authentication/models/user.py

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin
from django.db import models

class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        # Implement logic to create a regular user
        # ...

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        # Implement logic to create a superuser
        # ...

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    # Add additional fields as needed

    objects = CustomUserManager()

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    # Add REQUIRED_FIELDS if additional fields are required for user creation

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email
```

### Assigning Custom User Manager

Assign the custom user manager `CustomUserManager` to the `objects` attribute in the `CustomUser` model.

#### File: `apps/authentication/models/user.py`

```python
# apps/authentication/models/user.py

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    # ...
    objects = CustomUserManager()
    # ...
```

### Configuring AUTH_USER_MODEL

Specify the custom user model in the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting within the `settings.py` file.

#### File: `<project_name>/settings.py`

```python
# <project_name>/settings.py

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'app_name.CustomUser'
```

Replace `'app_name'` with the actual app name containing the custom user model.

**Note: Before proceeding, ensure that you have imported the custom user model from `apps/authentication/models/__init__.py` in your project.**

```python
# apps/authentication/models/__init__.py

from .user import CustomUser  # Import the CustomUser model
```

This concludes the model section, which covers the configuration and customization of the user model for authentication in the Django project.
