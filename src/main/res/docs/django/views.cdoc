# Views

Views in our project are responsible for handling the business logic of each app. These views, implemented as Django Restframework APIViews, encapsulate the functionality required to process incoming requests and produce appropriate responses. This section provides an overview of the view structure and includes a sample example to illustrate the implementation of views.

## View Structure

### File Organization

Views for a specific app are stored in the `apps/${appname}/views/` directory. Each view is defined in its own file, promoting a modular and organized codebase. Additionally, it is required that all views be imported in the `apps/${appname}/views/__init__.py` file to ensure proper integration with the app.

```plaintext
.
├── apps
│   ├── app1
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── models
│   │   │   # (Similar structure as mentioned in the Models section)
│   │   ├── serializers
│   │   │   # (Similar structure as mentioned in the Serializers section)
│   │   ├── urls.py
│   │   └── views
│   │       ├── __init__.py  # Import all views here
│   │       ├── view1.py  # Example: View handling business logic for app1
│   │       └── view2.py  # Example: Another view for app1
│   ├── app2
│   │   # (Similar structure as app1)
│   └── app3
│       # (Similar structure as app1)
```

### Sample View Implementation

Consider an example where an app named `example` requires a view to handle the retrieval of user profiles. The view implementation would be stored in `apps/example/views/profile_view.py`:

```python
# apps/example/views/profile_view.py

from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from .models.user_profile import UserProfile
from .serializers.user_profile_serializer import UserProfileSerializer

class ProfileView(APIView):
    """View for retrieving user profiles."""

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        """Handles GET requests to retrieve user profiles."""
        profiles = UserProfile.objects.all()
        serializer = UserProfileSerializer(profiles, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

And the `__init__.py` file in the `apps/${appname}/views/` directory:

```python
# apps/${appname}/views/__init__.py

from .view1 import *  # Import all views here
from .view2 import *  # Add more imports as needed
```

This ensures that all views are properly imported and can be accessed from other parts of the app.
