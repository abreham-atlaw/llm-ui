# Phases of Creating a New Functionality

Developing new functionality within our Django project involves several organized phases to ensure a smooth integration into the existing codebase. This section outlines the essential steps and best practices to follow when introducing a new feature or functionality.

## 1. Create Models

If the new functionality requires data storage, design and create the necessary Django models. These models will define the structure of the data and its relationships.

## 2. Implement Serializers

Create Django Restframework serializers to handle the conversion of data. Serializers can be used for validation, and a model or Python class is not necessary for serialization. Choose the appropriate serializer type based on the requirements. Each serializer will have it's own file under apps/<app_name>/serializers/ directory.

## 3. Develop Views

Implement Django Restframework APIViews to handle the business logic of the new functionality. These views will process incoming requests, interact with models, and produce appropriate responses.

## 4. Define URLs

Create a dedicated `urls.py` file for the new functionality within the app. Define URL patterns that map to the views implemented in the previous step. Ensure that the app's `urls.py` is included in the main `urls.py` of the project.

## Conclusion

By following these organized phases, you can ensure a systematic and reliable process for introducing new functionality into our Django project. This approach promotes maintainability, readability, and collaboration among the development team.
