The project will be classified into multiple smaller features which we will call apps. For eg. core, auth, payment, ...
Each app will have 3 layers: data, application, presentation. In this project's architecture, the three main layers—data, application, and presentation—interact seamlessly to deliver a cohesive and functional application. The data layer, responsible for managing entities and communication with the backend, provides models, serializers, requests, and repositories. These components encapsulate data-related operations. The application layer acts as a bridge, connecting the data and presentation layers. It hosts business logic, such as form validation and state management, using forms, states, and view models. View models interact with repositories from the data layer to fetch, modify, or create data. Finally, the presentation layer leverages Vue components to render the user interface. Views orchestrate the layout and incorporate components, creating a visually appealing and interactive experience. This structured approach ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the application modular, maintainable, and scalable. The layers collaborate harmoniously to deliver a robust and user-friendly application.
