# Development Phases Overview

The project development follows three key phases: Data Layer, Application Layer, and Presentation Layer. Each phase contributes to a modular and organized architecture, with distinct responsibilities and components.

## 1. Data Layer

### Purpose

Responsible for managing data within the application, the Data Layer interacts with external sources like REST APIs. It handles entities using models, serializers, requests, and repositories.

### Components

1. **Models:**
   - Definition: Classes or interfaces representing entities.

2. **Serializers:**
   - Definition: Classes converting models to/from JSON.

3. **Requests:**
   - Definition: Classes representing backend requests.

4. **Repositories:**
   - Definition: Classes managing model data from backend or local storage.

### Interactions

- Models define entity structure.
- Serializers convert models to/from JSON.
- Requests represent specific API calls.
- Repositories use the network client for request execution.

## 2. Application Layer

### Purpose

Connecting the Data and Presentation Layers, the Application Layer handles business logic, including form validation and state management. It orchestrates interactions between data and UI components.

### Components

1. **Forms:**
   - Definition: Classes extending the `Form` class for form-related functionality.

2. **States:**
   - Definition: Classes representing application and form states.

3. **ViewModels:**
   - Definition: Classes extending `AsyncViewModel` for methods interacting with the Data Layer.

### Interactions

- Forms handle form-related logic and validation.
- States manage application and form states.
- ViewModels interact with the Data Layer through repository methods.

## 3. Presentation Layer

### Purpose

Responsible for rendering the UI with Vue components, the Presentation Layer ensures a seamless user experience. It includes components for UI elements and views for complete pages.

### Components

1. **Components:**
   - Definition: Vue components representing smaller UI elements.

2. **Views:**
   - Definition: Vue components representing complete pages or larger sections.

### Interactions

- Components represent UI elements.
- Views use components to construct complete pages.
- Views interact with ViewModels for dynamic content and data flow.

## Conclusion

The development progresses through the Data, Application, and Presentation Layers, fostering a structured and modular architecture. Collaboration among developers in each layer enhances code maintainability, scalability, and facilitates seamless teamwork.
